# HateMapSeattle
Hate Map Seattle is an effort by STOMP to spot and map out the locations of hate groups and their activity throughout Seattle. This will be a public resource that anyone can reference. Knowing who the threat is and where they're active is necessary to keep yourself safe.

### What counts as hate?
While not comprehensive, we consider the following to be hate or signs of hate groups:
1. Graffiti, stickers, posters, or other media posted around Seattle that promotes or encourages hate groups (Nazis, Patriot Front, WLM, etc.)
2. People who are part of hate groups
3. People acting on behalf of hate groups
4. People who target LGBTQIA+, BIPOC, and other minority groups throughout Seattle

### What else is included in this map?
We also include incidents where minority groups were attacked or harassed, even if the incident wasn't related to a hate group. For instance, lone actors who might not have specific affiliations with a particular group, or dangerous incidents with cops.

###How do I report an incident that I think should be mapped?
Thank you for your interest! Currently we don't have a public way for people to report incidents. We plan to have an automated process for those part of the STOMP group, but those outside of STOMP will need to have reports verified before being added to the map. We appreciate your understanding.

### Developer's Note:
This started as an idea between STOMP members in response to an increase in Nazi, WLM, and Patriot Front graffiti popping up in and around Seattle. The 2024 election of Trump has caused immense stress for us all, and, without a doubt, will embolden hate groups across the globe. We won't allow this. We will keep Seattle a safe haven for those who cannot find hope in their home state. We will continue to live. We will resist, and we will survive.

**Existing as a trans person is resistance.**

**Experiencing trans joy is protest.**

**Survive, if not for ourselves, then for those who come next.**
